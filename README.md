# Forrelation
The HESS polynomial black-box algorithm solve a problem related to "Forrelation" problem.

Forrelation: A Problem that Optimally Separates Quantum from Classical Computing => https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5729

ref: https://www.quantamagazine.org/finally-a-problem-that-only-quantum-computers-will-ever-be-able-to-solve-20180621/

I am going to publish the code, of the algorithm that solve the problem related to "forrelation" if it helps to solve P vs NP you are invited to try it, you should only mention that the HESS algorithm is my creation.
